    projectDescription:
      "In February of 2021, Texas was hit by the worst winter storm in recent history. During that time, the state power grid crashed and questions were asked about the qualifications of the board. At KSAT, we investigated each board member and found many of them had made significant contributions to Texas Governor, Greg Abbott's, political campaigns. My role was finding the salaries of these members and their contributions and returning them in a Tableau visualization and CSV file for the lead author.",

    projectDescription:
      "I delved into the evolving landscape of basketball contracts, a realm where colossal deals have become the norm with no end in sight. However, the success of these contracts varies significantly. When deals fall short, teams find themselves committed to substantial financial obligations for underperforming players. Through my analysis, I've observed that while teams have a ballpark figure for a player's value, the race to secure top talent often leads to inflated contracts just to ensure a playerâ€™s allegiance.\nUtilizing Python's robust machine learning capabilities to devise a method for creating relevant salary projections based on individual player statistics. This approach offers a more objective basis for determining player compensation, aligning it more closely with their actual contributions on the court.",
